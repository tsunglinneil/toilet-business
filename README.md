### Developer Tips:
* Clone repository or download zip file directly
>>$ git clone url(git's url)
* Install virtual environment
>> pip install virtualenv
* Create virtualenv in the root(here is called toilet_business) folder
>>$ cd ..... (go into the root folder)  
>>$ virtualenv env
* Activate virtual env
>>$ source env/bin/activate (mac os)  
>>$ env\Scripts\activate (windows)
* Install requirement.txt on virtual environment (pip3 install -r requirement.txt) (for mac os)
  if your os is windows, skip this step and forward to the next step.
>>$ pip3 install -r requirement.txt
* Because of leveldb cannot be install with pip on windows, so copy the leveldb.pyd (doc folder) into YOUR_PYTHON_ROOT/Lib/site-packages,
  here we recommend to use virtual environment, so copy into YOUR_PYTHON_ROOT/env/Lib/site-packages and run commend:
>> pip install -r windows-requirement.txt
* Run main program called app.py to start local development server
>>$ python3 app.py
* Open browser http://127.0.0.1:5000/

### Git Tips:
* Recommend checkout into the branch (develop)
>> git checkout develop
* See now branch state
>> git status

    On branch develop
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
* commit your modify
>> git commit -m 'something about this commit'
* check remote repository
>> git remote -v
* push your modify (we are in the develop branch)
  -u commend is setting the upstream, and you can just use 'git push' next time.
>> git push -u origin develop
